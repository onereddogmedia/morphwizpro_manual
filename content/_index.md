## Welcome to MorphWiz 2

MorphWiz 2 is a spectral audio morphing synthesizer. Up to four sources (samples) can be combined to construct hybrid sounds. The resulting sound is a smooth transition in the timbre, for instance, a sound that starts as a trumpet and gradually changes into a cello. MorphWiz 2 includes an analyzer to incorporate your own samples, in addition to a vast array of synthesizer features. These include an arpeggiator, modulation matrix, four envelopes, up to four LFOs with complex curves, a morphable resonant filter, and an effects section.

MorphWiz 2 for iOS includes a multi-touch performance playing surface. As with a fretless stringed instrument, such as a violin, the playing surface enables precise control of the pitch and character of each synthesizer voice. The synthesizer engine is compatible with MIDI Polyphonic Expression (MPE).
