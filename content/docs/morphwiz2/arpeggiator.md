# Arpeggiator

MorphWiz 2 features a flexible and powerful arpeggiator. The arpgeggiator rack is shown when FX is selected on the Parameter menu and ARP is selected on the sub-section menu.

The arpeggiator subpage consists of two main sections:

* **Basic arpeggiator controls:** These buttons and knobs determine the basic behavior of the arpeggiator.

* **Arpeggiator sequencer controls:** These buttons, pop-up menus, and knobs let you edit one or more arpeggiator sequencers.

## Basic arpeggiator controls

The basic arpeggiator controls consist of several buttons, menus, and knobs.

* **Enable:** Turn the arpgeggiator on and off. When active, the aprgeggiator responds to incoming MIDI notes.

* **Direction:** Determine the order in which incoming notes are organized into a pattern, form the following choices:

    * **Up:** Plays the current notes from lowest to highest.

    * **Down:** Plays the current notes from highest to lowest.

    * **Up/Down:** Plays the current notes from lowest to highest and back again.

    * **Down/Up:** Plays the current notes from highest to lowest and back again.

    * **Played:** Plays the current notes in the order they were originally played.

    * **Random:** Plays the current notes in a random, non-repeating order.

* **Division:** The time between each arpeggiated note. 

* **Length:** Set the length of each arpeggiated note.

* **Octave:** Determine if the arpeggiator pattern is played only at its original pitch or across higher octaves when the pattern is repeated.

* **Swing:** Change the timing of the arpeggiator, moving even-numbered steps to later positions without changing the timing of odd-numbered steps. This can add a more relaxed feel or groove to the part. Swing generally works best when combined with a Rate knob setting of 1/4 of a beat (16th note swing feel) or a Rate knob setting of 1/2 a beat (8th note swing).

* **Ratchet:** The number of subdivisions of a note added to an arpeggiated note.

* **Chance:** Set the probability that an arpeggiated will be ratcheted.

* **Latch:** Hold the arpeggiator pattern when you lift your hands from the keyboard. Set to Off to stop the arpeggiator pattern when you lift your hands.

* **Tempo:** Set the global tempo.

## Arpeggiator sequencer

The arpeggiator sequencer section is similar in functionality to a step sequencer. Each bar represents a step. A step may be active or in-active, and used to modulate synthesizer parameters via the modulation matrix.

* **Target pop-up menu:** Choose the parameter to view and edit.

    * **Velocity:** Set the velocity of the note generated by the arpeggiator

    * **Tune:** Determines the tuning offsets for each step in semitones.

    * **Duration:** Set the note length for each step.

    * **Mod Wheel CC1:** Modulate the Mod Wheel source in the modulation matrix.

    * **Slide CC74:** Modulate the Slide source in the modulation matrix.

    * **Expr** :Modulate the Expr source in the modulation matrix.

* **Step Value bar:** Drag the bar up and down to change the value of the selected target parameter.

* **Step Enable:** Enable or disable the step.
