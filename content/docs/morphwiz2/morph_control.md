# Morph control

The morph controls determine how the four Sources are combined to produce a new timbre. It is shown when **MORPH** is selected on the Parameter menu. There are four basic types of interaction.

* **XY:** All four Sources are active and the X and Y knobs control the morph between them.

* **Linear:** All four Source are active and the Y knob controls the morph between them.

* **2:** Only Sources A and D are active and the Y knob controls the morph between them.

* **Single:** Only Source D is active and therefore there is no morphing of Sources.

## Morph parameters

* **X:** Sets the amount of morphing modulation along the X-axis.

* **Y:** Sets the amount of morphing modulation along the Y-axis.

* **XY Pad:** Drag the handle modulate the two X and Y parameters simultaneously. In Linear modes the handle modulates only the Y parameter.

* **Wizard:** The Wizard shows the real-time oscilloscope and frequency spectrum of each Voice, prior to the Effects section.
